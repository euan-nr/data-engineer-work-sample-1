# data-engineer-work-sample-1
My partial solution for a data engineering work sample question. To be completed.

The question can be seen at the following link: https://github.com/RiskThinking/work-samples/blob/main/Data-Engineer.md
Please download the required files and place them into the same folder as the .py files included.

I attempted problems 1 and 2, 3 and 4 currently in progress as a personal exercise for future benefit. 

Thanks to all involved and the opportunity to experience a task that a Data Engineer may have to execute.
